                            Between 1959 and 2020, 564 people travelled into space.
                            These people were selected for 1277 positions on 362
                            separate missions.

                            Early space travel was dominated by the international giants
                            of the time, the United States and Russia. To this day, the
                            vast majority of space exploration is carried out by one of
                            these two countries.

                            In more recent years however, astronauts have been selected
                            from a wider variety of nationalities, with every inhabited 
                            continent being represented in orbit. <br><br>

                            In the infancy of space travel, astronauts were almost
                            exclusively selected from the military, usually test pilots
                            from the various air forces. As the technology matured, the
                            focus of missions moved towards scientific endeavours.

                    <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                        <p>
                            This shift also brought on a shift in astronaut demographics.
                            Technical and scientific skills became a necessity so the
                            candidate pool extended into civilians far more frequently.
                            The advent of space tourism has also had an effect.

                    <p>
                        Males have been selected for space missions much more than
                        females. In total, only 11% of astronauts have been female.
                        <br><br>
                        Gender equality in space travel is increasing over time but
                        there is still a significant disparity.

                    <p>
                        The physical requirements of space exploration put an upper limit
                        on the age of those able to partake in astronaut programs. The experience
                        and intellectual requirements place limits on the other extreme
                        though. This has resulted in the vast majority of astronauts
                        being selected around the age of 35.

                            The development of technology has had a significant impact
                            on the skill sets required of astronauts. Initially, the
                            crews were small so a large portion of astronauts took on a
                            leadership role. Pilots were also commonplace onboard a
                            space craft as manual control was often required.
                            <br><br>
                            As the systems matured, a larger portion of the crew was
                            dedicated to specialists, able to perform scientific or
                            engineering work.

                        <p>
                            The increase in computing power over time has resulted in
                            less need for dedicated pilots and by the 2000s the role was
                            almost entirely made redundant. Instead, flight engineers
                            were required to maintain and operate the guidance systems
                            rather than manually controlling flight.
                            <br><br>
                            In recent years, space tourism has enabled people to take
                            part in space exploration without expert skills or
                            knowledge, opening the door to a much wider pool of
                            potential astronauts.
